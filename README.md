# Machine Learning-Based Approach for Symboling Prediction in Automobiles

## Project Description
This project aims to enhance automobile insurance risk assessment by employing machine learning models to predict symboling ratings, which denote insurance risk. Leveraging the Automobile dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, we explore various methods including PCA, LASSO, and Random Forest to select and analyze variables, thereby reducing multicollinearity and improving model accuracy.

## Methodology:
- **Variable Selection**: Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to address multicollinearity and select significant features.
- **Model Building**: Employing LASSO for regularization and feature selection, and Random Forest for creating a robust predictive model.

## Dataset
The Automobile dataset utilized in this project consists of 205 observations with 26 variables, ranging across both quantitative and categorical types. Key attributes include make, fuel type, body style, engine size, and more, with the target variable being the symboling rating that denotes insurance risk.
